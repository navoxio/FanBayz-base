                                    <li>Apart from free-trial Subscriptions, all Subscriptions to a Creator's profile will automatically renew at the end of the relevant subscription period, except if your payment card is declined, the subscription price for the Subscription has increased, or you have turned off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the relevant Creator's profile. This means that if you want to stop subscribing to a Creator's profile and paying continuing monthly subscription charges, you will need to turn off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the relevant Creator's profile.</li>

                                    <li>If you cancel a Subscription you will continue to be permitted to view the relevant Creator's Content until the end of the subscription period in which you cancelled, after which no further payments will be taken from your payment card in respect of subscriptions to that Creator's profile (unless you choose to pay for a new Subscription to that Creator’s profile), and you will no longer be able to view the relevant Creator's Content.</li>

                                    <li>You agree that you will not make unjustified requests for a refund in respect of any Fan/Creator Transaction or tip to a Creator, or unjustified chargeback requests of your payment card provider in relation to any Fan/Creator Transaction or tip to a Creator. If we consider that any request for a refund or chargeback request was made by you in bad faith, we have the right to suspend or delete your User account.</li>

                                        <strong>Wallet credits:</strong>
                                        You can prepay an amount on FanBayz (known as "Wallet Credits") which you can later use to make Fan Payments. Purchases on FanBayz cannot be divided - if you attempt a purchase that costs more than the total amount of your remaining Wallet Credits, your payment card will be charged the full amount for that purchase. Wallet Credits are subject to a maximum amount as determined by us from time to time. Interest will not accrue on Wallet Credits. Wallet Credits are non-refundable, which means that you are not entitled to a refund of any unused Wallet Credits.

                                    <li>Once you have set up your account as a Creator account, then if you want to charge your Fans a monthly subscription fee you will need to set your subscription price for your Fans within the range allowed by FanBayz.</li>

                                            <li>Our Fee will be deducted from the Fan Payment received and your Creator Earnings will be held by us or one of our subsidiary companies on your behalf.</li>

                                            <li>Your FanBayz account will be updated within a reasonable time with your Creator Earnings. Your Creator Earnings will become available for withdrawal by you from your FanBayz account once such Creator Earnings appear in your FanBayz account.</li>

                                            <li>To make a withdrawal of Creator Earnings from your FanBayz account, you must have at least the minimum payout amount in your FanBayz account.

                                            <li>The amount that you see in your ‘current balance’ in your FanBayz account is your Creator Earnings at the relevant time. All Fan Payments and Creator Earnings are transacted in Nigerian Naira only. For some payout options the Fan Payments and Creator Earnings figures will be reflected in your local currency, at an exchange rate controlled by the relevant payment services provider. Your bank may charge you currency conversion or transfer fees to receive the money. Additionally, your e-wallet company may charge you a fee for accessing the money. We do not have control over currency exchange rates or charges imposed by your bank or your e-wallet company, and we and our subsidiary companies will not be responsible for paying any charges imposed by your bank or your e-wallet company.</li>

We undertake no duty to pay Creator Earnings to third-party lienholders and may withhold payment of Creator Earnings until the lien has been removed.

                                            <li>If we are withholding all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you and we determine that part of the Creator Earnings withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity, then we may arrange for you to be paid the part of the Creator Earnings which we determine to be unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful or fraudulent activity. However, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us loss, we may withhold all Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid and we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.</li>
